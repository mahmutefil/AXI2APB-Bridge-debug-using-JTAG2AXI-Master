# AXI2APB-Bridge-degug-using-JTAG2AXI-Master
In this repository, the hardware tests for the RTL code that you can find in my profile ("AXI2APB-Bridge-Design-and-Verification") will be tested using the JTAG to AXI Master IP Core provided by XILINX. You will also be seeing the APB Slave RTL code that can also be found in my profile ("APB-Slave-Verification"). The Arty A7-35T development board is used to debug the proposed architecture and VIVADO block design is used to arranged the necessary modules and IP blocks. The AXI2APB Bridge module is placed by packaging an APB Master interface and the APB Slave module is added by packaging an APB Slave interface since these blocks are connected via interfaces. The software used is VIVADO 2019-2.
The system is tested by creating read and write transactions based on the JTAG2AXI IP Core build-in functions and you can find the related TCL file inside the ZIP file for creating and testing the hardware.
